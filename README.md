# Benchmarking Multi-Dimensional data analysis

This repository is a **simulated** bechmark of climate data analysis.

I try to refactor my old project code (senior project, 2019-2020) and find the better way to analyse, access, do the EDA with multi-dimensional data(climate data).

```txt
def: climate data, multi dimensional data
- mostly, it is in netCDF format.
- you can think it looks like numpy array with shape (time, row, col), the (row, col) is a map.
```

## Questions

- Does multi-processing, multi-threading speed up MKT?
