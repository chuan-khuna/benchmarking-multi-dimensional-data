# Benchmarking Multi-Dimensional data analysis

This repository is a **simulated** bechmark of climate data analysis.

I try to refactor my old project code (senior project, 2019-2020) and find the better way to analyse, access, do the EDA with multi-dimensional data(climate data).

```txt
def: climate data, multi dimensional data
- mostly, it is in netCDF format.
- you can think it looks like numpy array with shape (time, row, col), the (row, col) is a map.
```

## Inspiration

- The old code was very slow
  - to refactor or propose the better idea to do
- I have learnt a little about parallelism from DataCamp's writing effective R code.
  - to practise my parallel computing skills`

## Questions

- Does multi-processing, multi-threading speed up MKT?

## Files

- the prefix `b` represents benchmarking
- the prefix `v` represents visualisation

## Tested on ...

```txt
MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021), M1 Pro, 32GB unified memory
